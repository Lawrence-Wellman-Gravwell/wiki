### Additions

* Added debug interfaces to most components to get stack traces and CPU/Memory profiles using the SIGUSR1 signal.
* Added additional log on query completion that shows local disk usage which helps identify excessively expensive queries.
* Added `-maxtracked` and `-maxsize` flags to the `first`, `last`, and `unique` modules to prevent unexpected resource exhaustion.
* Improved internal logging around shard management.

### Bug Fixes
 
* Fixed an issue where an indexer could drop a file lock when repairing many shards.
* Fixed an issue where multiple overlapping AX modules targeting multiple tags could provide incorrect acceleration hints.
* Fixed an issue where the kits interface could sometimes show resources from other kits.

## Ingester Changes

### Additions

* Improved health check API on HTTP ingester to indicate if the ingester would block on a request.
* Improved resource utilization on the Federator and Indexer when servicing many clients.

### Bug Fixes

* Fixed an issue in the ingest library that can cause resource starvation when under extremely high load with many concurrent data flows.
